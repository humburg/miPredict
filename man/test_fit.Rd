\usage{
test_fit(
  model,
  data,
  outcome,
  metrics = c("auc", "specificity", "sensitivity", "accuracy", "precision"),
  bootstrap = FALSE,
  iter = 2000,
  level = 0.95
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An object of class \link{glm}.}

\item{data}{Data to use in performance assessment. Either a data frame or an object of class \link{mids} (see Details).}

\item{outcome}{Name of outcome in \code{data}.}

\item{metrics}{Character vector indicating which performance measures should be computed. One or more of \emph{auc}, \emph{specificity}, \emph{sensitivity}, \emph{accuracy}, \emph{precision}.}

\item{bootstrap}{Logical indicating whether bootstrap samples should be generated from \code{data}.}

\item{iter}{Number of bootstrap iterations to use.}

\item{level}{Width of the confidence interval.}
}
\value{
A list of performance measures of the same length as \code{metrics}.
}
\description{
Compute model performance metrics.
}
\section{Available performance metrics:}{
Confidence intervals may be calculated for a range of performance metrics, including the AUC, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. Of these all except AUC
depend on the choice of classification cut-off used. The metrics reported by this function are at the cut-off which maximises the sum of sensitivity and specificity,
i.e. the Youden Index.
}

\section{Using multiply imputed data:}{
If \code{data} is of class \link{mids} the imputed datasets will be collapsed into a single dataset before performance metrics are computed.
